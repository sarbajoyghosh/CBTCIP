[Task 1:Student Grade Management ]
(https://github.com/sarbajoyghosh/CBTCIP/blob/main/studentgrademanagementsystem.c)
================================

Description
-----------
The Student Grade Management program is designed to facilitate the management of student grades. It allows users to input student information and multiple subject scores, calculate and display average scores, identify the highest/lowest scores, and provide a comprehensive summary of students' performance. This tool is particularly useful for teachers and administrators to gain valuable insights into students' academic achievements.


Features
---------
* Input Student Information: Add and manage student details including names and subject scores.
* Calculate Averages: Automatically calculate and display average scores for each student.
* Identify Extremes: Determine the highest and lowest scores among students.
* Performance Summary: Generate a summary report of students' performance.


[Task 4:Expense Tracker]
(https://github.com/sarbajoyghosh/CBTCIP/blob/main/expensetracker.c)
========================


Description
------------
The Expense Tracker application enables users to record and categorize their daily expenditures. It allows users to input their expenses, generates visual reports, and offers insights into spending patterns. This tool assists users in managing their finances effectively by providing a user-friendly interface, implementing data storage, and visualizing data trends.

Features
----------
* Input Expenses: Record daily expenditures with categories.
* Visual Reports: Generate visual reports to analyze spending patterns.
* Insights: Offer insights into spending habits to manage finances better.


[Task 2:Word Count Tool ]
(https://github.com/sarbajoyghosh/CBTCIP/blob/main/wordcounttool.c)
=========================

Description
------------
The Word Count Tool is a user-friendly C program designed to read a text file and accurately calculate the total number of words, lines, and characters within the document. This tool provides an efficient and convenient way for users to analyze the content and gain insights into the structure of their textual data. It is a great project for strengthening programming skills, particularly in file handling, string manipulation, and basic text analysis in C.

Features
---------
* Reads text files specified by the user.
* Counts and displays the total number of characters in the file.
* Counts and displays the total number of words in the file.
* Counts and displays the total number of lines in the file.
* Handles various word delimiters such as spaces, newlines, and end-of-file.


[Task 3:Bank Account Management]
================================

Description
------------
This project is a simulation of a bank account management system. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, and calculate interest based on different account types. The goal of this project is to provide a basic framework for understanding how banking systems operate and to practice programming concepts related to data management and user interaction.

Features
---------
* Account Creation:

 * Users can create different types of bank accounts (e.g., savings, checking).
 * Each account has a unique account number and associated user information.

* Deposit and Withdrawal:

 * Users can deposit funds into their accounts.
 * Users can withdraw funds from their accounts, with checks for sufficient balance.

* Balance Inquiry:

 * Users can check the current balance of their accounts at any time.
* Interest Calculation:

 * The system calculates interest for savings accounts based on predefined rates.
 * Interest is applied to the account balance at specified intervals.
* Transaction History:

 * The system keeps a record of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals) for each account.
 * Users can view their transaction history for better account management.
